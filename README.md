## Project Description

**Objective:**  
This research explores the diffusion of risks within supply chains under different network configurations, emphasizing the role of structural visibility. Computational simulations were used to analyze risk propagation across random, small-world, and scale-free networks. Key findings suggest that improved visibility into multi-tier supplier networks enhances resilience by reducing the cascading effects of disruptions.

**Research Questions:**  
1. How does network structure influence the speed and extent of risk diffusion in supply chains?
2. What role does structural visibility play in mitigating cascading risks?
3. How do different initial health levels affect recovery in small-world networks compared to other configurations? 

**Significance:** 
Supply chain disruptions can propagate through global and interconnected networks, resulting in systemic risks. By understanding how risks diffuse across various network types, this research provides actionable insights into improving supply chain robustness through network design and visibility strategies.
