## Analysis Structure

### **References**
The `References/` folder includes supporting materials, such as:
- Research paper and articles on network science and supply chain resilience.
- Background literature cited in the project.

### **Code**
The `code.ipynb` file contains the python script used for the analysis. This script performs:
- Generation of network structures (random, small-world, and scale-free networks).
- Computation of key network metrics such as clustering coefficients, degree distributions, and average path lengths.
- Simulation of risk propagation using a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.
- Visualization of simulation results.
